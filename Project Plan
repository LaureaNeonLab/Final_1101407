Project plan – WorldHello

WorldHello is a mobile app which purpose is to be able to send messages to random people across the world. Both the sender and receiver of the message would be anonymous. In other words the app would serve no real purpose, but I thought it would be interesting experiment to see if such thing is possible and how it would be done.

By now I have gone to the conclusion that the program would definitely be possible to make, though I doubt I will manage to finish it in time for this course nor in near future as I feel like I got overly ambitious with this project and do not have the required skills to finish this project, though I hope I can do it later in my life when my skills develop.

As of right now the program's visual style has been finished, but it lacks it's main functionality which is sending and receiving the messages.
